# MachineHub

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This is a Vite project, not a Vue CLI project.**
> Please use the scripts defined in `package.json` (e.g., `yarn build`, `yarn dev`). Do **not** use `vue-cli-service` as it is not installed and will cause errors.

A comprehensive machine learning platform for developers and data scientists, built with Vite, Tailwind CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- `yarn` or `npm` as your package manager

### Installation
Install the project dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:
```bash
yarn install
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn dev`
This command starts the development server. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) (or the URL provided in your terminal) to view the application in your browser. The server supports hot-reloading, so the page will update automatically as you edit the code.

### `yarn build`
This command builds the application for production. It bundles all the files into a `dist` directory, optimizing them for performance. **This is the correct command to build your project.**

### `yarn preview`
This command starts a local server to preview the production build from the `dist` directory. It's a useful way to test the final output before deploying it to a live environment.

**Important Note:** This project uses **Vite**, not Vue CLI. Commands like `vue-cli-service` are not applicable here. Please use the `yarn` scripts listed above to work with this project.
